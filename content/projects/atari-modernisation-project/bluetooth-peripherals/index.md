This is a neat device that allows you to connect bluetooth peripherals to your ST including modern mice and joypads. Out of the box it works well with joypads, but takes a little bit of software tinkering to enable mouse support.

I don't particularly mind using the ST mouse but cmopatible joysticks and controllers are getting increasingly more difficult and expensive to source. In this case it made more sense to find a way to take advantage of all the controllers I do have. Enter the Unijoysticle 2 A500! These clever devices are primarily designed with Amigas in mind but work well with the ST as well. Some things to note:

- The device does not fit underneath the ST and will require DB9 extension cables to plug in.
- Mouse support targets Amiga by default and takes a little reconfiguring of the firmware to set up for ST.

## Getting a Unijoysticle
The Unijoysticle is the work of Ricardo Quesada, check out [his page](https://retro.moe/unijoysticle2/) on the Unijoysticle 2 for information on how to get it. You can order it directly from him, or use his open source schematics and firmware to assemble one yourself. I'm pretty basic so I ordered the premade one.

## Installing the Unijoysticle
- While it can run directly on the power from the DB9 ports, the power draw may interfere with ACSI2STM so external USB power is recommended.
