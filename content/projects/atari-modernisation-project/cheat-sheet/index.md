## Bootup
You can press certain keys to skip booting from `AUTO` folders or spinning up such as accessories on boot. Hold these keys down just after booting. [(Source)](https://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?p=158889#p158889)
- Use `Alternate` to prevent booting from hard disk.
- Use `Control` to prevent booting from floppy disk.


## EmuTOS
- Associate file types with an application by "installing" the application. Select an application's `.PRG` file and use `Options > Install application...`. For example, to associate `.TXT` files with `Protext`, select `PROTEXT.PRG` and set the following configuration options:
  - **Document type:** `TXT`
  - **Default dir:** `Application`
  - **Parameter:** `Full path`
