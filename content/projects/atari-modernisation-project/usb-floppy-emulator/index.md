A quick guide on using a Gotek USB floppy emulator in your ST, conveniently store all your floppy images on a single drive and never have to worry about worn out floppy drive belts again!

<!--more-->

The Gotek was the first accessory I got for my ST. It makes sense after all, the floppy drive is the only way to interact with data on your ST by default. It's well worth having even if you intend to set up an HDD as many games struggle with being run from a hard drive, and many more don't work well with EmuTOS, which [I recommend](/posts/tos-is-rubbish) as a modern replacement to the installed operating system.

## Getting a Gotek
I purchased my Gotek through Ebay from a local seller, there doesn't seem to be an "official" place to purchase them from but searching for `Gotek USB` will give you several places to purchase them from. The Gotek I use does not have a rotary encoder which I don't believe will fit in the ST's case without modification.

## Installing the Gotek
- Twisted cable?

## Setting up <boot software name>

- What's that boot software again?
  - Setting up pages
  - Keeping track with ExCeL mofo
