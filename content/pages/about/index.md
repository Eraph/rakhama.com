Tea. Early Grey. Hot.

Howdy! My name's Phil, some of my friends call me Garcia. Still not wholly sure why. This is my guide to the galaxy. Well, it's mostly a guide to Linux and Atari STs. Actually it's hardly a guide, I barely know what I'm doing myself. Welcome to my inaccurately named website.

As for me, well I grew up in Scotland and made the move to Australia back in 2014. I'm a software developer by trade, primarily web technologies built with a .NET backend. When I'm not working I can be found spending time with my wee family, tinkering with retro computers, or riding my motorbike.
