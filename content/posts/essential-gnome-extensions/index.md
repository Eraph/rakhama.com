Gnome is a great, low-distraction desktop environment but it's certainly not perfect out of the box. Fortunately it's easy to spruce up. Here are some of my favourite extensions!

<!--more-->

## [Space Bar](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5090/space-bar/)

I'll start with an extension I really love and now consider crucial. Space Bar makes workspaces a lot more practical in Gnome. I have mine named so that each workspace has a specific purpose. A neat way to organise your in-use apps. Best used in conjunction with [Auto Move Windows](#auto-move-windows)

## [Auto Move Windows](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/)

Allows you to configures apps to open in a specific workspace. Give those workspaces purpose!

## [Media Label and Controls (Mpris Label)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4928/mpris-label/)

Not only shows you what's playing in the top bar, but has configurable click functionality to play/pause, skip tracks, and more. Pretty great!

## [Resource Monitor](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1634/resource-monitor/)

Keep an eye on those computer resources of yours with this highly configurable extension. I have mine set up to show CPU usage % and temperature, as well as RAM usage %. It does heaps more though, fill yr top bar.

## [Grand Theft Focus](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5410/grand-theft-focus/)

Fixes some weird hidden window behaviour that happens far too often without it.

## [Battery Indicator Icon](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5718/battery-indicator-icon/)

Shows a nice icon and battery percentage in the top bar.

## [Favourites in AppGrid](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4485/favourites-in-appgrid/)

I don't know about you but even though I have an app favourited, I still want to see it in the AppGrid.

## [RebootToUEFI](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5105/reboottouefi/)

Sometimes a dude just needs to reboot into UEFI (formerly known as BIOS). This adds the option to the shutdown menu.
