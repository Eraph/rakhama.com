Well I've been thinking I'm boxing myself into a corner with this website of mine focusing primarily on tech stuff. That's not all I do! So for a change I'm going to write about some of my favourite albums because why not.

## Rolo Tomassi - Where Myth Becomes Memory

The most recent album in this list is easily one of my favourites. I got (really really) into Rolo Tomassi shortly after the release of their second album and have listened to them going from strength to strength.

While their earlier material leaned heavily into a jazz-infused, syncopated flavour, their more recent efforts have settled on a more accessible sound. That's not too say it's for everyone, still highly technical and very, very heavy in a lot of places, this album presents itself as the unintentional final chapter of a trilogy of albums beginning with the excellent Grievances.

Every song on Where Myth Becomes Memory is eminently listenable, rich with technique and catchy hooks. I love it, and even more than two years after release I can't get enough of it.

## Every Time I Die - Low Teens

No, this isn't an album about depressed adolescents. The title comes from a weather report during a particularly tough time for lead singer Keith Buckley. The story behind aforementioned tough time sets the stage for this album, in my opinion the best material in their back catalogue. 

Personal highlights include the crushing track Petal, a reflection on the fragility of life and how this could have gone wrong.
