      <title>Hosting Podman Containers on Systemd with Quadlets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking into alternatives to Docker Compose for Podman (yes, there is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html&#34;&gt;podman-compose&lt;/a&gt; wrapper that brings similar functionality to Podman), and stumbled across the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html&#34;&gt;Quadlets&lt;/a&gt;. Well, turns out they&amp;rsquo;re nothing like Docker Compose, perhaps more like Kubernetes or one of them fellas. Indeed, the name Quadlet was supposedly named after a squashed Kubelet. Geddit? Squashed kube? A quad? Ah, never mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alternatives Series: Social Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is always changing, there&amp;rsquo;s no denying that. But the latest haps have many of us quite worried. Society at large seems to be hurtling towards fascism, a vocal minority of affluent and angry men propped up by big tech dragging us all deeper into the ugliest depths of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I singled out Big Tech there because it&amp;rsquo;s something that probably the majority of us are actively participating in. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way! In this post I will outline some of the alternatives available to the big social network platforms, hopefully giving you some inspiration to step away from these increasingly toxic places.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Await an Async GDScript Function From C#</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like that Godot has its own, simple scripting language in GDScript, but I&amp;rsquo;m a .NET tragic so it&amp;rsquo;s C# for me. Interoperability between the two is possible, but not always obvious. Case in point, how do you await an async GDScript method? Well, it depends&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of an upcoming piece of work, it was suggested to me that I spend some time getting familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tailwindcss.com/&#34;&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d heard good things from colleagues, one comment in particular suggesting it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold you back like other CSS frameworks. So I was quite keen to dig in and see what was so special about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gnome is a great, low-distraction desktop environment but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not perfect out of the box. Fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s easy to spruce up. Here are some of my favourite extensions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you still downloading &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; files like some kinda chump? Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://scoop.sh&#34;&gt;Scoop&lt;/a&gt;, a package manager for Windows not too dissimilar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://chocolatey.org&#34;&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; which ought to be very familiar to any Linux enthusiast. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use, and it&amp;rsquo;s open source. Yes, Scoop is great but this article is not about extolling the virtues of the package management tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Run a Blazor Web Application as Maui Mobile App</title>
      <link>https://rakhama.com/posts/run-blazor-web-application-as-maui-mobile-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 14:20:14 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rakhama.com/posts/run-blazor-web-application-as-maui-mobile-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took some time to investigate developing a MAUI mobile app that shares business logic with a Blazor web app by way of ViewModels and the like. What I discovered was that MAUI and XAML is a pretty cumbersome framework. My colleague Kael &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaels-kabbage.com/posts/cross-platform-options-a-very-shallow-exploration/#maui-blazor-hybrid&#34;&gt;gave me some insight&lt;/a&gt; on the possibility of building a Blazor app and running that as a MAUI app. After looking into it in more detail I came to the conclusion that having a single application with multiple deployment targets is a more practical approach to cross-platform development. This article serves as a guide to developing a single application that can be deployed as both a website and an Android app. Of course there are a few platform specific things to look out for but they&amp;rsquo;re easily handled as I will demonstrate in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>All in One Guide to Setting Up Ssh</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This guide is mostly a reference for myself as it&amp;rsquo;s a workflow that I find myself following whenever I set up a new Linux machine. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here as I&amp;rsquo;m sure many will find this useful, and it will save me from looking up each distinct step in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity to add some bonus network configuration tips to get the most out of the setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Auto Unlock Fedora Encrypted Drive</title>
      <link>https://rakhama.com/posts/auto-unlock-fedora-drive/</link>

      <guid>https://rakhama.com/posts/auto-unlock-fedora-drive/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently installed Fedora on my personal laptop to replace Manjaro as I found Manjaro to be a just a little too flaky for my liking and I know Fedora to be a solid alternative. During installation I was asked if I wanted to encrypt my drives. Now I&amp;rsquo;m not harbouring anything particularly sensitive but I thought it was worth doing, security first and all that; after all, we expect every website to support HTTPS these days so why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there is the matter of that mildly pesky login prompt on every boot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Mystery of the Atari ST&#39;s Bad DMA: Solved?</title>
      <link>https://rakhama.com/posts/atari-st-bad-dma-solved/</link>

      <guid>https://rakhama.com/posts/atari-st-bad-dma-solved/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I set up my own SD-HDD solution based on the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/retro16/acsi2stm&#34;&gt;ACSI2STM&lt;/a&gt; project, I found the hard drive was becoming corrupted pretty soon after setting it up. I thought it might have been my dodgy soldering or something funny about the way I had everything set up. Turns out I simply hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard about &lt;a href=&#34;https://exxosforum.co.uk/articles/DMA.html&#34;&gt;Bad DMA&lt;/a&gt;. A local Atari enthusiast meetup later and a solution was proposed; swap the 68000 chip for a newer, lower power and subsequently less noisy version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fluxor for Dummies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor&#34;&gt;Fluxor&lt;/a&gt; is a Flux implementation for Blazor in the vein of Redux. It is a state management system designed for larger software systems that encourages immutability of state, pure functions and clean separation of code. Given my fairly basic understanding of the Flux pattern I thought it would be valuable to document what it is at a high level and what&amp;rsquo;s required when using Fluxor to implement the various concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blazor With MVVM</title>
      <link>https://rakhama.com/posts/blazor-with-mvvm/</link>

      <guid>https://rakhama.com/posts/blazor-with-mvvm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;MVVM is a development pattern that has been around for a while now. It was designed to facilitate the development of WPF applications for Windows and is still used for the likes of &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm&#34;&gt;Maui&lt;/a&gt; apps. I reckon it has a place in Blazor apps as a neat way to separate view from logic, and as a sort of volatile state management for when you don&amp;rsquo;t want state to persist between pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Debug Server Hosted Blazor Web Assembly in VS Code</title>
      <link>https://rakhama.com/posts/debug-server-hosted-blazor-wasm/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 16:20:25 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rakhama.com/posts/debug-server-hosted-blazor-wasm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A published Blazor WebAssembly instance is just a collection of files that can be loaded into a browser. If these files are hosted on the API, running the API means the UI is running as well, probably from the same address. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s a little different to debug compared to launching it standalone, but not any more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TOS Is Rubbish</title>

      <guid>https://rakhama.com/posts/tos-is-rubbish/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never noticed it growing up but I see it now, TOS is profoundly flakey. My ST has a TOS 1.62 ROM built in and it does not play nice with hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a simple solution to this, use the wonderful open source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emutos/emutos&#34;&gt;EmuTOS&lt;/a&gt; instead. Now I&amp;rsquo;m not resourceful enough to go writing EmuTOS to a flash ROM but my ST does have enough RAM that I can easily get away with loading it up from the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solid Principles: A Cheat Sheet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a single-page cheat sheet that summarised SOLID software development principles, so I made one. For each of the letters in SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) there are a couple of bullet points explaining the benefits of adopting them and the smells that betray their violation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Asp.NET Self-Signed Certificates and Fedora</title>

      <guid>https://rakhama.com/posts/asp-net-self-signed-certs-fedora/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I spent a bit of time fighting with certificates in an ASP.NET application I&amp;rsquo;m working on. The scenario is we have Blazor Server communicating with a Minimal API. Debugging locally I was struggling to get the two to communicate, with errors like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote certificate is invalid because of errors in the certificate chain: UntrustedRoot&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slight Delay With Bluetooth Mouse in Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick tip here for when a bluetooth mouse takes a moment to react after not being used for a few seconds. Bluetooth autosuspend can be disabled with a negligible power consumption penalty by setting a kernel parameter on boot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about why I think the Godot game engine is a good alternative to Unity as part of my alternatives series of posts, but for now I want to share for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake how to use SQLite.NET in Godot. Skip to the end to add the one package necessary to get SQLite.NET working in Godot.
For the uninitiated, SQLite.NET is an ORM for SQLite, similar to Entity Framework. SQLite is a good fit for games and I&amp;rsquo;m fond of using an ORM where possible.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of questionable ethical behaviours going on with big technology companies these days. Hearing horror stories from Meta (formerly Facebook,) Alphabet (Google,) Amazon, Microsoft and Apple has left me with a rather sour taste in my mouth. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally been stung by bait-and-switch campaigns like when OneDrive revoked large amounts of free storage and LastPass nerfed their free tier subscription. The former was ultimately reversed with a workaround but I was shook; these big companies can make drastic changes to these services I rely on at a whim.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a whole number of years since I owned an Atari ST. Well over 20. In my youth I (and by &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; I mean &amp;ldquo;my family&amp;rdquo;) had two, both of which packed in after some time, the last kicking the bucket in the mid to late 90s. Ever since then I&amp;rsquo;ve longed to have another, even as I moved briefly to the Amiga before joining the PC train in 1999.</description>
