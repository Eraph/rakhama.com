      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a whole number of years since I owned an Atari ST. Well over 20. In my youth I (and by &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; I mean &amp;ldquo;my family&amp;rdquo;) had two, both of which packed in after some time, the last kicking the bucket in the mid to late 90s. Ever since then I&amp;rsquo;ve longed to have another, even as I moved briefly to the Amiga before joining the PC train in 1999.</description>
