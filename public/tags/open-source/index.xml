      <title>Hosting Podman Containers on Systemd with Quadlets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking into alternatives to Docker Compose for Podman (yes, there is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html&#34;&gt;podman-compose&lt;/a&gt; wrapper that brings similar functionality to Podman), and stumbled across the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html&#34;&gt;Quadlets&lt;/a&gt;. Well, turns out they&amp;rsquo;re nothing like Docker Compose, perhaps more like Kubernetes or one of them fellas. Indeed, the name Quadlet was supposedly named after a squashed Kubelet. Geddit? Squashed kube? A quad? Ah, never mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alternatives Series: Social Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is always changing, there&amp;rsquo;s no denying that. But the latest haps have many of us quite worried. Society at large seems to be hurtling towards fascism, a vocal minority of affluent and angry men propped up by big tech dragging us all deeper into the ugliest depths of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I singled out Big Tech there because it&amp;rsquo;s something that probably the majority of us are actively participating in. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way! In this post I will outline some of the alternatives available to the big social network platforms, hopefully giving you some inspiration to step away from these increasingly toxic places.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Essential Gnome Extensions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gnome is a great, low-distraction desktop environment but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not perfect out of the box. Fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s easy to spruce up. Here are some of my favourite extensions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go big or go home! I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and off this project for nearly ten years. Originally developed in Unity, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to &lt;a href=&#34;https://rakhama.com/series/godot&#34;&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; because I&amp;rsquo;m an Open Source shill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s not much here yet I&amp;rsquo;m afraid, but I hope to write more about this soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you still downloading &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; files like some kinda chump? Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://scoop.sh&#34;&gt;Scoop&lt;/a&gt;, a package manager for Windows not too dissimilar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://chocolatey.org&#34;&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; which ought to be very familiar to any Linux enthusiast. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use, and it&amp;rsquo;s open source. Yes, Scoop is great but this article is not about extolling the virtues of the package management tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>All in One Guide to Setting Up Ssh</title>
      <link>https://rakhama.com/posts/all-in-one-guide-to-setting-up-ssh/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This guide is mostly a reference for myself as it&amp;rsquo;s a workflow that I find myself following whenever I set up a new Linux machine. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here as I&amp;rsquo;m sure many will find this useful, and it will save me from looking up each distinct step in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity to add some bonus network configuration tips to get the most out of the setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TOS Is Rubbish</title>
      <link>https://rakhama.com/posts/tos-is-rubbish/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never noticed it growing up but I see it now, TOS is profoundly flakey. My ST has a TOS 1.62 ROM built in and it does not play nice with hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a simple solution to this, use the wonderful open source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emutos/emutos&#34;&gt;EmuTOS&lt;/a&gt; instead. Now I&amp;rsquo;m not resourceful enough to go writing EmuTOS to a flash ROM but my ST does have enough RAM that I can easily get away with loading it up from the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
