      <title>Auto Unlock Fedora Encrypted Drive</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently installed Fedora on my personal laptop to replace Manjaro as I found Manjaro to be a just a little too flaky for my liking and I know Fedora to be a solid alternative. During installation I was asked if I wanted to encrypt my drives. Now I&amp;rsquo;m not harbouring anything particularly sensitive but I thought it was worth doing, security first and all that; after all, we expect every website to support HTTPS these days so why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there is the matter of that mildly pesky login prompt on every boot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Asp.NET Self-Signed Certificates and Fedora</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I spent a bit of time fighting with certificates in an ASP.NET application I&amp;rsquo;m working on. The scenario is we have Blazor Server communicating with a Minimal API. Debugging locally I was struggling to get the two to communicate, with errors like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote certificate is invalid because of errors in the certificate chain: UntrustedRoot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Slight Delay With Bluetooth Mouse in Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick tip here for when a bluetooth mouse takes a moment to react after not being used for a few seconds. Bluetooth autosuspend can be disabled with a negligible power consumption penalty by setting a kernel parameter on boot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
