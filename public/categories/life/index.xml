      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is always changing, there&amp;rsquo;s no denying that. But the latest haps have many of us quite worried. Society at large seems to be hurtling towards fascism, a vocal minority of affluent and angry men propped up by big tech dragging us all deeper into the ugliest depths of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I singled out Big Tech there because it&amp;rsquo;s something that probably the majority of us are actively participating in. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way! In this post I will outline some of the alternatives available to the big social network platforms, hopefully giving you some inspiration to step away from these incrasingly toxic places.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
